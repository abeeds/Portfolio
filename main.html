                    Hi, I'm Shahria. I went to NYU Tandon School of
                    Engineering. I'm a developer who use Python, Node.JS,
                    HTML/CSS/JS, and a couple others. I have experience building 
                    full-stack applications and programming microcontrollers 
                    and circuits.
